# TikTacToeBot

//This project uses alpha beta pruning to determine the computers move in an 8x8 game of tic-tac-toe essentially.
//The variable of how many in a row or a column needed to win can be changed but defaulted at 4
//Given the option of who goes first, try and beat the AI!
//I wasn't able to make the bot fast enough to do a turn in 5 seconds so I made the max 30 seconds per turn. The bot is more difficult to beat this way.
To run the code simply build the main.java class and run!
I'm fairly certain I made the interface manageable too, but just in case look at the main code if problems
